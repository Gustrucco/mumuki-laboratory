Mumuki
======

Distribute and validate programming exercises

# What is Mumuki?

Mumuki is just a simple platform that allows users to store and distribute programming exercises - that is a problem
description and a set of automated tests -, and submit solutions to them.

It is aimed to assist people to learn programing languages and paradigms.

# Supported Languages

Currently Mumuki supports Haskell, through [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/), and Prolog,
through [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/). Support for more programming languages is pending task.
